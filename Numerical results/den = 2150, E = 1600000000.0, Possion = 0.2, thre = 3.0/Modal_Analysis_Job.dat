 NOTE:
      (1) SINCE ABAQUS DOES NOT PRE-ALLOCATE MEMORY AND ONLY ALLOCATES MEMORY AS NEEDED DURING THE ANALYSIS,
          THE MEMORY REQUIREMENT PRINTED HERE CAN ONLY BE VIEWED AS A GENERAL GUIDELINE BASED ON THE BEST
          KNOWLEDGE AVAILABLE AT THE BEGINNING OF A STEP BEFORE THE SOLUTION PROCESS HAS BEGUN.
      (2) THE ESTIMATE IS NORMALLY UPDATED AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERY STEP. IT IS THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THE
          ESTIMATE FROM THE CURRENT STEP TO THE LAST STEP OF THE ANALYSIS, WITH UNSYMMETRIC SOLUTION TAKEN
          INTO ACCOUNT IF APPLICABLE. 
      (3) SINCE THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON THE ACTIVE DEGREES OF FREEDOM IN THE FIRST ITERATION OF THE 
          CURRENT STEP, THE MEMORY ESTIMATE MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN ACTUAL USAGE FOR 
          PROBLEMS WITH SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN ACTIVE DEGREES OF FREEDOM BETWEEN STEPS (OR EVEN WITHIN
          THE SAME STEP). EXAMPLES ARE: PROBLEMS WITH SIGNIFICANT CONTACT CHANGES, PROBLEMS WITH MODEL
          CHANGE, PROBLEMS WITH BOTH STATIC STEP AND STEADY STATE DYNAMIC PROCEDURES WHERE ACOUSTIC 
          ELEMENTS WILL ONLY BE ACTIVATED IN THE STEADY STATE DYNAMIC STEPS.
      (4) FOR MULTI-PROCESS EXECUTION, THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS FOR EACH PROCESS
          IS BASED ON AN INITIAL SCHEDULING OF OPERATIONS AND MIGHT NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL FLOATING 
          POINT OPERATIONS COMPLETED ON EACH PROCESS. OPERATIONS ARE DYNAMICALLY BALANCED DURING EXECUTION, 
          SO THE ACTUAL BALANCE OF OPERATIONS BETWEEN PROCESSES IS EXPECTED TO BE BETTER THAN THE ESTIMATE
          PRINTED HERE.
      (5) THE UPPER LIMIT OF MEMORY THAT CAN BE ALLOCATED BY ABAQUS WILL IN GENERAL DEPEND ON THE VALUE OF
          THE "MEMORY" PARAMETER AND THE AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL MEMORY AVAILABLE ON THE MACHINE. PLEASE SEE
          THE "ABAQUS ANALYSIS USER'S MANUAL" FOR MORE DETAILS. THE ACTUAL USAGE OF MEMORY AND OF DISK
          SPACE FOR SCRATCH DATA WILL DEPEND ON THIS UPPER LIMIT AS WELL AS THE MEMORY REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE
          I/O. IF THE MEMORY UPPER LIMIT IS GREATER THAN THE MEMORY REQUIRED TO MINIMIZE I/O, THEN THE ACTUAL
          MEMORY USAGE WILL BE CLOSE TO THE ESTIMATED "MEMORY TO MINIMIZE I/O" VALUE, AND THE SCRATCH DISK
          USAGE WILL BE CLOSE-TO-ZERO; OTHERWISE, THE ACTUAL MEMORY USED WILL BE CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUSLY
          MENTIONED MEMORY LIMIT, AND THE SCRATCH DISK USAGE WILL BE ROUGHLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE DIFFERENCE
          BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED "MEMORY TO MINIMIZE I/O" AND THE MEMORY UPPER LIMIT. HOWEVER ACCURATE
          ESTIMATE OF THE SCRATCH DISK SPACE IS NOT POSSIBLE.
      (6) USING "*RESTART, WRITE" CAN GENERATE A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA WRITTEN IN THE WORK DIRECTORY.
